#+STARTUP: showall
#+TITLE: Containers for Idris

This packages provides containers not defined in Idris =base=, =prelude=, or =contrib=, for use in Idris programmes. They are built:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
primarily with existence in mind rather than a dependently typed construction. The latter /may/ come later.
#+END_QUOTE

If you would like to contribute please see [[CONTRIBUTING.md]] that offers some guidance. At the moment I am doing some work in the =dev= branch and =master= is the stable version.

* Motivation
The ordered motivation behind these data structures are:

1. My work requires the use of data structures that may not already be in the =Idris= base package.
2. I do not like the implementation of a certain container and am providing an alternate construction.
3. An exercise in implementing different data structures using functional programming.
4. An exercise in using dependent types to implement different data structures.

* Provided Containers
+ AVL Tree implementations of:
  + Tree.
  + Dictionary.
  + Set.
+ Graphs using Adjacency Lists.
+ Stack Based Queue
+ List based Stack
+ Dependently Typed AVL tree.

* Testing and Build Quality
The containers built here are *rough and ready*. They may fail; they may not work as intended. There will be code duplication, there may not be documentation.

If there is something missing, that you would like to see please contribute. I welcome reasonable PR and changes to design.

There is a rudimentary testing suite that needs extending, and checks of the implementation's need performing. There is a [[https://github.com/david-christiansen/idris-quickcheck][QuickCheck port to Idris]] out there but it *may* have [[https://github.com/david-christiansen/idris-quickcheck/issues/1#issuecomment-249865836][bit-rotten away]].

Also please read the [[CONTRIBUTING.md][contributing]] guidelines, for everyone's sanity.
